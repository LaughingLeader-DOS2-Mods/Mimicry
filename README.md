Mimicry for Divinity: Original Sin 2
=======

Mimicry, inspired by [the Mime from Final Fantasy Tactics](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Mime_(Tactics)), adds a new "job" in the form of a Mime. The Mime can mimic the actions of allies in battle, has a collection of interesting passives, and has scaling unarmed damage.

# Features:

## The Mime

### Unlocking

#### Mask of Mimicry

The mime job is unlocked on a character by wearing The Mask of Mimicry. Simply wearing it unlocks all the mime passives and skills.

_Restrictions: Mimes are muted, and therefore cannot cast spells! The power of mimicking comes at a cost..._

#### Mime Follower

As an alternative to dedicating a party member to the life of a mime, a mime follower can be recruited, and acts as a permanent summon.

_Restrictions: The mime follower can only mimic the actions of the character who recruited them._

#### Class Preset

Mimicry also adds a new Mime class preset, allowing you to unlock the Mime from the start.

### Mimicking

Mimes can mimic the actions of allies in battle.

#### Skill Mimicking

Both skills and position/target settings are mimicked. Meaning, if a skill was cast on the caster, the mime will cast that skill on themselves. If a skill was cast 10m ahead on an enemy, then the mime will cast 10m ahead and prioritize an enemy target.

*Copied Settings:*
* Target Position
* Target Preference (Ally, Enemy, or None)
* Caster Weapons

*Restrictions:*
* Source skills are ignored.
* Special-type shout skills are ignored (as these tend to be special skills from mods, like menu skills).
* Path skills are ignored.
* Summon skills are ignored.
* Favourable Wind is ignored.
		
#### Attack Mimicking
	
Like skills, basic attacks are mimicked, and the attacker's target position, target preference, and weapons copied.

*Copied Settings:*
* Target Position
* Target Preference (Ally, Enemy, or None)
* Caster Weapons

*Restrictions:*
* If no target is found, the attack will "miss", due to the way DOS2's basic attack system works (weapon attacks don't have an area of effect like skills can).
	
#### Item Mimicking

The following item types are mimicked:

* Potions
* Food
* Drinks

Item mimicking can be disabled in the host settings menu.

### Passives

#### Brawler

Mimes are innately gifted with unarmed combat.

*Random Bonus Damage*
* Every 3rd hit, unarmed attacks will deal random bonus damage. 

*Double Strike*
* Critical unarmed strikes will cause a Double Strike (one free hit per turn).

*Innate 5% Damage*
* Brawlers gain a small 5% bonus to all damage.
	
*Brawler Stance Skill*
* A skill that toggles the Brawler Stance, which makes the Mime's fists scale to their level and chosen attribute (Constitution, Strength, or Finesse).

#### Concentration

While unarmed, mimes gain a 100% bonus to accuracy, ensuring attacks will never miss.

#### Beastmaster

Friendly summons within 10m to the mime gain new abilities.
