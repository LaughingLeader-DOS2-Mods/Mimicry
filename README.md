Mimicry for Divinity: Original Sin 2
=======

Mimicry, inspired by [the Mime from Final Fantasy Tactics](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Mime_(Tactics)), adds a new "job" in the form of a Mime. The Mime can mimic the actions of allies in battle, has a collection of interesting passives, and has scaling unarmed damage.

## The Mime

### Unlocking

#### Mask of Mimicry

The mime job is unlocked on a character by wearing The Mask of Mimicry. Simply wearing it unlocks all the mime passives and skills.

_Restrictions: Mimes are muted in combat, and therefore cannot cast regular non-weapon skills! The power of mimicking comes at a cost._

 If you wish to become a mime without the preset, only one mask exists in the game, which belongs to...

#### Mime Follower

As an alternative to dedicating a party member to the life of a mime, a mime follower can be recruited, and acts as a permanent summon. To recruit the Mime follower, use the music box sold at the LeaderLib trader.

_Restrictions: The mime follower can only mimic the actions of the character who recruited them._

If the mime follower dies, he can be revived either through talking to his ghost, or regular means of resurrection. If the _unthinkable_ happens and you choose a particular option when talking to his ghost, your actions can be undone by using the music box once more.

##### Music Box

As stated previously, the music box acts as a summoning conduit for the mime follower. It's available at Old Man Lothar, the LeaderLib trader. Once recruited, the music box is a quick way to summon the follower to your position.

#### Class Preset

Mimicry also adds a new Mime class preset, allowing you to unlock the Mime from the start. This preset is also available in the LeaderLib preset menu.

### Mimicking

Mimes can mimic the actions of allies in battle.

#### Skill Mimicking

Both skills and position/target settings are mimicked. Meaning, if a skill was cast on the caster, the mime will cast that skill on themselves. If a skill was cast 10m ahead on an enemy, then the mime will cast 10m ahead and prioritize an enemy target.

*Mimicked Attributes:*
* Target Position
* Target Preference (Ally, Enemy, or None)
* Caster Weapons

*Restrictions:*
* Source skills are ignored.
* Special-type shout skills are ignored (as these tend to be special skills from mods, like menu skills).
* Rush & Jump skills are ignored.
* Summon skills are ignored.
* Favourable Wind is ignored.
		
#### Attack Mimicking
	
Like skills, basic attacks are mimicked, and the attacker's target position, target preference, and weapons are mimicked.

*Mimicked Attributes:*
* Target Position
* Target Preference (Ally, Enemy, or None)
* Caster Weapons

*Restrictions:*
* If no target is found, the attack will "miss", due to the way DOS2's basic attack system works (weapon attacks don't have an area of effect like skills do).
	
#### Item Mimicking

The following item types are mimicked:

* Potions
* Food
* Drinks

Self-preservation is enabled by default, so an undead ally drinking poison won't be mimicked by a non-undead character, and vice versa.

Item mimicking can be disabled in the host settings menu, and self-preservation can be disabled in the mime settings menu (both available in the Mimicry settings menu).

#### Source Mimicking & Source Regeneration

Mimes can unlock an ability at level 10 or higher that allows them to mimic one source ability per combat.

Additionally, at level 10 or higher, mimes will regenerate 1 source point every 60 seconds outside of combat, or every 10 turns within combat.

### Passives

#### Brawler

Mimes are innately gifted with unarmed combat.

*Unarmed Bonus Damage*
* Every 3rd consecutive unarmed hit on a target deals random bonus damage. 

*Double Strike*
* Critical unarmed strikes have a 40% chance to cause a Double Strike (one free hit). Double Strikes won't occur during a mimicked attack.

*Innate 5% Damage*
* Brawlers gain a small 5% bonus to all damage.
	
*Brawler Stance Skill*
* A skill that toggles the Brawler Stance, granting the Mime the Brawler's Fist, a two-handed unarmed weapon. The Brawler's Fist scales to the Mime's level and chosen attribute (Constitution by default). Every few levels, the Brawler's Fist will gain new bonuses.

#### Concentration

While unarmed, mimes gain a large bonus to accuracy.

#### Beastmaster

Friendly summons within 15m to a mime gain new abilities.

##### Monster Skills:

| Summon | Monster Skill |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Bloated Corpse | Shackles of Pain |
| Bone Pile | Crippling Blow |
| Cat | Horrific Scream |
| Condor | Favourable Wind |
| Fire Ooze | Fireball |
| Fire Slug | Fireball |
| Giant Incarnate | Overthrow |
| Ifan's Soul Wolf | Bull Rush |
| Incarnate (Small) | Forced Evolution (New skill added by Mimicry) |
| Incarnate (Giant) | Varies depending on the incarnate elemental type. |
| Oil Blob | Midnight Oil |
| Plant Monster | Bad Breath (New skill added by Mimicry) |
| Poison Ooze | Poison Dart |
| Water Ooze | Hail Strike |
| Totem | Totem Rage Status (Increased Crit Chance) |
| Any Unlisted Summon | Wish (New skill added by Mimicry) |

### Mime Skills

Mime skills are only usable as a mime. Unequipping the Mask of Mimicry will result in the removal of all mime skills, but they'll magically come back when the mask is equipped once more.

#### Buying Mime Skills

Mime skills can be purchased from the Mask of Mimicry itself, available when meditating (use the Inner Reflection skill or the LeaderLib mod menu).

Special Features:
* The Mask sells new mime skills at various levels. You'll get an in-game notification when new skills are available, and this will be obvious in the main mime menu.
* Non-mime related items in its inventory can be "liquidated" into gold, for keeping a tidy merchant inventory.
