Mimicry for Divinity: Origin Sin 2 - Definitive Edition
=======

Mimicry, inspired by the Mime job from Final Fantasy Tactics, adds a new "class" called the Mime. Mimes can mimic the actions of allies in battle, utilize Mime-only skills, take advantage of Mime-only passives, and pummel enemies with scaled unarmed damage.
